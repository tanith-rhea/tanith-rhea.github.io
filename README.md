### Hullo

if you'd like to know the reason for all this mess, find me on tumblr under the same username

the stylesheet "ficrecs" and "seyche tansy" aren't my own and I simply changed a few little things to better suit my tumblr page aesthetic. Their owners are referenced in the files.</br>I've only uploaded them here, to facilitate editing the tumblr pages and keeping their codes clean.
